🛡️ FastAPI Auth API with JWT Security

This project is a secure authentication API built with FastAPI, featuring JWT-based authentication for user registration, login, and access to protected routes. It is designed to showcase clean, scalable, and secure backend architecture using modern technologies, with a focus on performance and simplicity.

🔑 Key Features:

User Registration & Login: Secure user registration and login flow with password hashing.

JWT Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless, secure, and efficient authentication.

Protected Routes: Access-controlled routes that require valid tokens for access, demonstrating token-based user validation.

Password Hashing: User passwords are securely stored using bcrypt, ensuring data protection.

FastAPI: Modern Python web framework optimized for high performance, asynchronous operations, and clean code.

MongoDB: NoSQL database for efficient storage of user credentials and future scalability.


📦 Technologies Used:

FastAPI for API creation and routing.

JWT for secure authentication and token generation.

bcrypt for secure password hashing.

MongoDB as the NoSQL database for storing user data.

Docker for containerization and ease of deployment.

Uvicorn for ASGI server.


🚀 Deployment Ready:
This application can be easily deployed to platforms like Heroku or Vercel using Docker and is configured to be highly portable and scalable.

📄 Future Enhancements:
Full user management system (password reset, account deactivation)
